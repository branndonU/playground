# Playground React (Vite)

Minimal Vite + React template created in workspace root.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server and open a local dev URL.

Files created:
- `package.json` - project scripts and deps
- `vite.config.js` - Vite config with React plugin
- `index.html` - app entry
- `src/` - React source (App.jsx, main.jsx, styles)

If you want TypeScript, routing, or additional features, tell me and I'll add them.
